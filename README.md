<h3>Hint</h3>
<p>**To see project code files in folders use visual studio. There are filters in visual studio project file, they look like folders in file explorer window in the right part of a screen.**</p>

<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>For use this program you must have installed directx 11 om your computer. Also to build project from source code you must have Qt 5.9 on yout computer. I used Visual studio 2013 community edition for build project and didn't test other development environement such as Qt Creator for building. Builded Qt libraries as .dll files you can download from next section "Builded .exe file" and then place them in source code project folder.</p>

<h3>Builded .exe file</h3>
